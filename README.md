TinyArcs
========

This code provides an implementation of the TinyArcs tracking method described in this paper:

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2011.09.066

It is essentially a velocity Verlet integrator which uses circle arcs arther than straight line steps.

The code includes help, so after compiling, run TA2 -h for a full listing of available config file 
options and the correct command line arguments to use.
